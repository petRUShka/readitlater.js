** livejournal.com
** habrahabr.ru
** www.trud.ru
** lenta.ru

h1. Installing

Put @readitlater.js@ and @_libly.js@ into @~/.vimperator/plugin/@.

h1. Setting up

 Firstly, you should get API Key at page http://readitlaterlist.com/api/signup/. Then you should add such string to your (probably empty) .vimperatorrc:

@let g:readitlater_api_key = "api key"@

And then you should save your login and password in standart Firefox password manager on readitlaterlist.com
